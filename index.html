<b class="f">You may well ask: &ldquo;How can I start using <abbr>HTML5</abbr> if older browsers don&rsquo;t support it?&rdquo; But the question itself is misleading. <abbr>HTML5</abbr> is not one big thing; it is a collection of individual features. So you can&rsquo;t detect &ldquo;<abbr>HTML5</abbr> support,&rdquo; because that doesn&rsquo;t make any sense. But you <em>can</em> detect support for individual features, like canvas, video, or geolocation.

<h2 id="techniques">Detection Techniques</h2>

<p>When your browser renders a web page, it constructs a Document Object Model (<abbr><dfn>DOM</dfn></abbr>), a collection of objects that represent the <abbr>HTML</abbr> elements on the page. Every element &mdash; every <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>, every <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>, every <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> &mdash; is represented in the <abbr>DOM</abbr> by a different object. (There are also global objects, like <code>window</code> and <code>document</code>, that aren&rsquo;t tied to specific elements.)

<p>All <abbr>DOM</abbr> objects share a set of common properties, but some objects have more than others. In browsers that support <abbr>HTML5</abbr> features, certain objects will have unique properties. A quick peek at the <abbr>DOM</abbr> will tell you which features are supported.

<p>There are four basic techniques for detecting whether a browser supports a particular feature. From simplest to most complex:

<u>
<li>
<p>Check if a certain property exists on a global object (such as <code>window</code> or <code>navigator</code>).
<li>
<p>Create an element, then check if a certain property exists on that element.
<li>
<p>Create an element, check if a certain method exists on that element, then call the method and check the value it returns.
<li>
<p>Create an element, set a property to a certain value, then check if the property has retained its value.
</ol>
